# multi-platform-job-scraper

This app, when completed, will be able to concurrently scrape job listings from multiple job search platforms and then save the 
responses to a s=csv file for later reference. 

It is a subset of a bigger project -- a job recommeder platform.

Current websites covered are:

- LinkedIn
- Indeed
- Glassdoor 
- Jobberman

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions on how to improve the code base.
